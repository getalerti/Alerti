## How it works

Alerti is a combination of open source tools. We’re building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products. If the tools and communities exist, with an MIT, Apache 2, or equivalent open licens, we will use and support that tool. If the tool doesn't exist, we build and open source it ourselves. Our aim is to give developers the best experience building their own Data Intelligence platform using open source tools.

**Current architecture**

Alerti is a [hosted platform](https://app.alerti.com). You can sign up and start using Supabase without installing anything. We are still creating the local development experience - this is now our core focus, along with platform stability.

- [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud) is a file sync app that lets you store all of your files online, and keep them synced with all of your devices. With over 10 years of active development Nextcloud has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- [Apache Superset](https://github.com/apache/superset) Apache Superset is a Data Visualization and Data Exploration Platform. It's a modern, enterprise-ready business intelligence web application.
- [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost) is The #1 headless Node.js CMS for professional publishing.


#### Client libraries

Our client library is modular. Each sub-library is a standalone implementation for a single external system. This is one of the ways we support existing tools.
